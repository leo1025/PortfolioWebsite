                <p>I'm a Peruvian Immigrant who came to the United States at a young age. Raised in Louisville Kentucky. As a low-income immigrant, college was at the time a distant dream. It was thanks to the Ivy Plus Program at Fern Creek High School that I proved myself and went to Dartmouth College. Where I studied for 5 years and graduated with a B.A. in Computer Science and Digital Arts.</p>
                <p>My experiences from my life and the people I've met have formed a simple desire. <strong>To make people smile</strong>. As simplistic as this motivation is, it is what fuels my work in Computer Science and Digital arts.</p>
