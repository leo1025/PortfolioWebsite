 Personal Repository for my Portfolio Website

This repo is the source-code for my Personal Creative Portfolio website. It is made in a blog style to allow for easy content creation and analytics using a Ghost Headless CMS. Running on the same server as the NextJS WebApp. The Ghost CMS can be accessed using a subdomain, with content and post security managed by the Ghost OpenSource package. The NextJS App implements Backend communication with the Ghost Database to retrieve post data and display it quickly and efficiently. There is only ever a few calls per page for the Ghost CMS. This allows for the website to dynamically update posts and projects without ever going into the source code.
